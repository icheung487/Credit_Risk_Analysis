# Credit_Risk_Analysis

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Fast Lending wants to use machine learning to predict credit risk.  We will build different machine learning models to predict credit risk.  The purpose is to train and evaluate different models to see which model would be best to predict credit risk

Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

# Resampling:

* Balance accuracy score - 64%
* Precision scores <> high-risk 0.01 <> low-risk 1.00
* Recall scores <> high-risk 0.59 <> low-risk 0.69
* Avg/Total 99% for precision & 69% for recall (sensitivity)


Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
